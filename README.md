# HEURISTIC-APPROXIMATION
 HEURISTIC APPROXIMATION!!!!!!!!
In computer science, artificial intelligence, and mathematical
optimization, a heuristic is a technique designed for solving a
problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for
finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any
exact solution.
 Provide a feasible solution without guarantee on its optimality,
or even quality, or algorithm running time.
 Well-designed heuristics for particular problem classes have
been empirically shown to find good solutions fast.
 Examples of heuristic algorithms:
- Lagrangian
 -Greedy Construct
 -Local Search
Problem: Implement a travelling Salesman program (TSP)
● A list of ciƟes to be visited
● Pairwise distances between the ciƟes
● Must return to the home/starƟng city
